# Brief Explanation
This project contains a sample PHP application that connects to the Watson Personality Insights
service in Bluemix. It is meant as exercise to get familiar with calling Watson services from a PHP application. The PHP file only contains the skeleton explaining
how this could be done. An actual sample implementation can be found in the 'cheatsheet' folder.
